# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
- In this Project, I have applied Binary Classification on Dataset extracted from Cleveland Database (particularly used for Machine Learning).
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Dataset, and find insights about the data by Analyzing by Visually Representing the Data.
- Compared different machine learning model's accuracy for final Modelling.

- Compared between: KNN, Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier
- Performed Hyperparameter Tuning to increase the accuracy of Models.
- Extracted Evaluation Matices for Performance Insights.
Performing:
ROC Curve and AUC Scores
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report: Presision Score, Recall Score and f1 Score
Cross Validation
- Fianlly, performed Feature Importance to see which all parameters contributes majority differences.
